# Irrigation System 

## Overview
This project is an automated irrigation system designed to water plants efficiently. It uses sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and controls water flow to ensure optimal plant growth. The system is built using an Arduino microcontroller and various electrical and mechanical components.

## Tools:

- Arduino
- Electrical Components:
  - Soil moisture sensor
  - Water pump
  - Relay module
  - Jumper wires
  - Power supply
- Mechanical components:
  - Water reservoir
  - Tubing
  - Plant pots

## Features
- **Automated Watering**: The system automatically waters plants based on soil moisture levels.
- **Manual Override**: Users can manually control the watering process.
- **LCD Display**: Displays real-time soil moisture levels and system status.
- **Low Water Alert**: Alerts when the water reservoir is low.
